# track-field-slackbot     
This is a slackbot that will send a random greeting and excuse to my track team's slack channel telling them I can't come to practice.

## Demo
This small demo below shows the original functionality of the chatbot. I made the bot's name/photo identical to mine in order to seem like I am actually sending the messages. Since then I have also added basic responses in the event that someone else attempts to interact with it.
